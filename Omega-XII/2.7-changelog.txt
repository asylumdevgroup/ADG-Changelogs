Switched to semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Revision)
"Major" Updates are "reset" updates, that require you to start a new world. The Next Major update is 3.0.0, coming in February or March.
"Minor" Updates are updates that add, update, and/or remove new Mods, but nothing game-breaking.
"Revision" Updates contain solely mod updates (usually under ten mods per update) and config changes.
