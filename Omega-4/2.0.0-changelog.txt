ADG Omega 4 2.0.0 Changelog

This is the first of a series of major content updates meant to "clean up" and refine the modpack. These major updates will release every 2-3 weeks, with smaller updates twice a week between.

NOTE 1: A New World is highly recommended for this update, as there are several new mods, as well as almost all of the existing mods updated.
NOTE 2: Yes, I know, there are duplicate ores. I'll fix that in 2.0.1, coming next Wednesday.
